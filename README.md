## Introduction

Fish Fight is a tactical 2D shooter, played by up to 4 players online or on a shared screen. Aim either left or right; the rest is up to clever movement and positioning in this fish-on-fish brawler! For more information about our origin story (Duck Game et.al.) and big-picture plans, see our [design document](https://www.notion.so/erlendsh/Fish-Fight-1647ed74217e4e38a59bd28f4f5bc81a).

### Key Features (WIP)

- Customize characters with hats, saved to your cross-platform profile
- Create & explore user-made weapons, levels, audio and other scripted extensions
