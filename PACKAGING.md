### Build

```sh
# export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target
cargo run --release --locked
```

### Package

Binary will be located at `target/release/fishfight` after [build](#build). To run it, `assets` directory should be placed in the same directory or a path can be specified via `FISHFIGHT_ASSETS` environment variable.

For example:

```sh
export FISHFIGHT_ASSETS=/opt/fishfight/assets/
target/release/fishfight
```

Also see [README.md#distro-packages](./README.md#distro-packages)

### Binary releases

Binary releases are automated via [Continuous Deployment](./.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow and they can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/fishfight/FishFight/releases) page. Release artifacts are named in the following format:

- `fishfight-<version>-<target>.<ext>`

A single archive includes the `fishfight` binary and `assets` directory. It can be verified by using a SHA256 hash file that has the same name as the artifact except it ends with ".sha256". Release artifacts are not signed at this time.
